# Madlibs

The Mad Libs project is a  word game that allows users to create humorous and creative stories by filling in the missing words in a pre-written template. The project is typically implemented as a console-based application where user is prompted to provide types of words, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, without knowing the context of the story.
